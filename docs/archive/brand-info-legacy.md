üìã Product Information

What is Tesoro CRM?

Tesoro CRM is a CRM specialized in the real estate sector (real estate agents), designed to streamline the workflow of sales, matching, customer relationships, and deal management.

Features:
‚Ä¢ Specifically built for real estate agents, with features such as property management, property matching, relationships between customers and objects.
‚Ä¢ Integration with external email services such as Gmail / Outlook (Office 365) for synchronization of email, contacts, calendar, etc.
‚Ä¢ Automation and AI-supported workflows to minimize routine tasks (follow-up, data management).
‚Ä¢ Website / listing integration: Tesoro is able to connect real estate inventory in real-time with external platforms (via MLS, XML import/export) and integrates with external listing services.

Note: Some details you have already decided in your pricing structure and portal flow, which I include below.

‚∏ª

üéØ Target Audience

Primary Audience

Real estate agents (in Spain and possibly broader markets) who actively search for clients (Home Finders) ‚Äî those who want to sell, close deals, build relationships and not simply wait for incoming leads.

Secondary Audience

Offices / real estate networks that want to scale, need multiple users, require customization or integrations, or want to use a specialized CRM for real estate internally.

‚∏ª

üí° Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

What makes Tesoro unique?

Tesoro is not just a generic CRM ‚Äî it shifts the role of the real estate agent from passive recipient to active sales agent, with smart matching, feedback loops via customer portal, and integration of communication at deal level.

Key Differentiators
1. Active matching + proposal process
Tesoro generates suggestions (multiple times per day) based on customer profiles; the agent decides which properties to show to the customer.
2. Feedback via portal with status flows
The customer reviews proposals, marks properties as interesting/not interesting, and Tesoro processes this in the trajectory.
3. Integration with external email/calendar/contacts
Tesoro connects with Gmail/Outlook so all communication becomes part of the deal workflow.
4. Real estate-focused modules & integrations
Modules for property management, listing synchronization (MLS, XML), relationships between property and customer, website integration.
5. AI/automation at the core
Automatic follow-up, data analysis, signal monitoring, intelligence to prevent loss.

# Tesoro CRM ‚Äî Guidelines, DNA & Foundations for Marketing & Website

## Introduction
This document is the guideline for everything related to marketing, copy, UI/UX and development for Tesoro CRM. You use this as a truth test: new pages, claims and interface must fit what is stated here.

---

## I. Core of Tesoro CRM

### 1. Purpose & mission
- Tesoro is not a generic tool ‚Äî it is a **sales machine for real estate agents (Home Finders)**
- We want to save real estate agents time, close deals AND strengthen relationships
- Our drive: minimize all activities that cost you time so you can focus on your customer

### 2. Positioning/uniqueness
- **Sales-oriented instead of platform-oriented**: other CRMs often focus on website, emails, portals; we focus on what needs to be sold
- **Proactive matching vs reactive waiting**: Tesoro searches, suggests, you decide
- **Relationship building built-in**: via portal, feedback loops, transparency
- **Integration and synergy**: we connect with your existing email services (Office 365/Google) ‚Äî no own mail server, but full collaboration
- **Innovative and adaptive**: AI agents, signal analyses, data-driven growth

---

## II. What we offer now / where to build trust

- Matching algorithm: suggestions twice a day based on customer profile
- Kanban interface/"Proposed lane": agent selects what customer sees
- Customer portal with feedback (customer rates "interesting/not interesting")
- Automatic notifications & signal monitoring for stagnating deals/leads
- Communication integration: emails & conversations linked to deal context
- Transparency in cost structure & integrations

---

## III. Pricing & Plans

### Subscription & license
- **‚Ç¨99 excl. VAT per month** for maximum 10 users
- For more than 10 users: **price on request/custom**

### Provisions & adjustments
- Small branding/visual adjustments (color scheme, logo, font): fixed price **‚Ç¨495**
- Custom work, design, development on request: can go up to **‚âà ‚Ç¨5,000**, depending on scope

### Integration & what is NOT included
- **Email hosting is not part of Tesoro**
- Instead, we integrate fully with **Office 365** and **Google Business/Workspace**
- This integration ensures your professional email, calendar and contacts remain via your trusted platform, while Tesoro brings everything together in your sales flow

---

## IV. Integrations with Office 365 & Google Business

We don't build our own mail server ‚Äî we believe this work is best left to specialized services. What we do: we integrate.

### What the integration enables

| Functionality | Description |
|---|---|
| **Email synchronization/logging** | Emails sent or received via Office/Google automatically linked to the correct lead/deal in Tesoro |
| **Contact synchronization** | Contact details synchronized between email account and Tesoro (add/update) |
| **Calendar/agenda connection** | Appointments in Outlook/Google Calendar appear in Tesoro and vice versa |
| **Email sending from Tesoro** | When sending from Tesoro, your linked email address is used (so external presentation remains consistent) |
| **Security & authorization** | Use of OAuth/official APIs (Microsoft Graph API, Google APIs) with minimal rights and security |
| **Configuration by user** | Admin/user can set up the connection, select folders/labels, manage sync directions |
| **Error handling & logs** | Notification for sync issues, possibility for manual linking/correction, audit logs |

### How to communicate this on the site/marketing

You can include this in your "What's included/what's not" section:

> Tesoro offers **no email hosting**, but integrates seamlessly with Office 365 & Google Business.
> - All communication is automatically linked to your deals in Tesoro
> - Calendars, contacts, email sending: synchronous and consistent
> - No extra mail servers or management on your part ‚Äî you use what you already know, with extra sales power on top

---

## V. How we help customers: the journey & value

1. **Wish profile & matching**
   - You define customer wishes, Tesoro searches and generates suitable properties
2. **Selection & proposal**
   - You move the best proposals to the "Proposed lane"
3. **Customer interaction in portal**
   - Customer views, marks properties as interesting/not
   - Property shifts status based on customer action
4. **Follow-up & conversion**
   - You see feedback & act: viewing, negotiation
   - Tesoro signals deals that stagnate
5. **Relationship & retention via portal**
   - Portal stays active after deal: status updates, documents, new suggestions
   - You continuously build trust & connection

---

## VI. Guidelines & rules for marketing/website/copy

### Do's
- Be clear about what makes Tesoro different compared to generic CRMs
- Use consistent terms: lead, deal, matching, portal, priority
- Show costs transparently: what's included, what's optional
- Communicate integration with Office/Google as advantage, not as "not included"
- Give visual flow diagrams/infographic to explain matching/portal process
- Use terms in real estate agent language, but introduce your terminology gradually (bridge)

### Don'ts
- Avoid vagueness or over-promising ("email hosting included")
- No feature spam without context
- Be careful with inconsistent use of terms (don't change "deal" to "project" on another page)
- No technical claims without proof
- No hidden costs ‚Äî be honest and transparent

If you want, I can translate this document to an internal style guide (with design rules, color schemes, tone of voice) and a short "one pager" that your marketing manager can learn by heart. Do you want me to make that?
